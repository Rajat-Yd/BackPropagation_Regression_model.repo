# BackPropagation_Regression_model.repo
A simple DL Model to calculate average salary Package based on students CGPA and Resume score.
# What is BackPropagation ? :
- Backpropagation is the essence of neural net training.
- It is the practice of fine-tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate (i.e. loss) obtained in the previous epoch (i.e. iteration.) Proper tuning of the weights ensures lower error rates, making the model reliable by increasing its generalization.
# About Model :
- This simple Neural network have One Input Layer.
- One Hidden layer and One Output Layer.
- It is a Regression model build using python language and without Keras Implementation.
